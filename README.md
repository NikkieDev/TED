#### This is an Alpha project.
I will probably develop this in C/C++ (Mostly C, Fuck C++), and there's no guarantee that I will finish this or even start it.  
There will hopefully be: 
1. A VSCode Extension
2. An Application for Windows
3. A CLI application for Linux & Windows
4. Fuck any MacOS users.
